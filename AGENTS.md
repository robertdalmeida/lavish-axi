# AGENTS.md

This file is loaded every session. It keeps only rules that apply to almost every change. Detail lives in the doc that owns it.

- [README.md](README.md) owns the user-facing contract: features, CLI flags, environment variables, keyboard shortcuts, export and share, and session-end etiquette.
- CLI output owns what agents are told while using Lavish: `lavish-axi --help`, `lavish-axi design`, and `lavish-axi playbook <id>` (`src/cli.js`, `src/design-reference.js`, `src/playbooks.js`). The generated skill (`src/skill.js` to `skills/lavish/SKILL.md`) stays a stub that points at those commands. Do not copy CLI-owned instructions into the skill.
- [VISION.md](VISION.md) owns the acceptance policy. Change it only through the author.
- [docs/invariants.md](docs/invariants.md) owns architecture internals, security rationale, and easy-to-reintroduce failure modes. Read the section for the area you are editing before changing it.
- Update the owner when a contract changes. Edit this file only when an every-session rule changes.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm run check          # build, lint, format check, typecheck, tests, and skill freshness
pnpm run build          # bundle dist/cli.mjs and copy chrome/design assets into dist
pnpm run build:skill    # regenerate skills/lavish/SKILL.md from src/skill.js
pnpm test               # node:test runner (test/*.test.js)
pnpm run lint           # ESLint over bin src test scripts
pnpm run format:check   # Prettier check
pnpm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit (checkJs)
```

One file: `node --test test/server.test.js`. One name: `node --test --test-name-pattern "createOpenOutput" test/cli-output.test.js`.
Opt-in browser suites need `chrome-devtools-axi`: `LAVISH_AXI_BROWSER_E2E=1 node --test test/layout-audit-browser.test.js test/layout-warning-inbox.browser.test.js`.
Seven-tab pool regression: `LAVISH_AXI_BROWSER_E2E=1 node --test test/event-transport.browser.test.js`.
`prepack` and `prepare` both run `build`. `pnpm run check` fails if `skills/lavish/SKILL.md` drifts from `createSkillMarkdown()`, or if root `plugin.json` drifts from `pnpm run build:plugin`. Release-please bumps `plugin.json` through `extra-files`.

## Project conventions

- Node 22+, ESM-only JavaScript (`"type": "module"`). No TypeScript source. `.js` files are validated with `checkJs`.
- Use TDD for bug fixes and new features (see the `test-driven-development` skill).
- Run `pnpm run check` before pushing.
- Treat repo-provided `.agents/` skill content as vendored. Prettier ignores it.
- Do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or `.release-please-manifest.json`. Release-please owns them.
- Human-authored PRs to `main` go through [no-mistakes](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes) >= 1.46.0. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) owns the gate, the attestation contract, and the workflow-pin rules.
- Tests that start the server set `LAVISH_AXI_STATE_DIR` and use an ephemeral port.
- `run()` returns on `--version` / `-v` / `-V` before `ensureStateDir` and telemetry (`test/cli-version.test.js`). New startup work goes after that short-circuit.
- `canonicalFile` runs `realpath`. Two paths to the same file are one session.
- `normalizeArgv` must let AXI `RESERVED_COMMANDS` (including `update`) pass through. A bare `lavish-axi update` must not become `open update`.

## Safety and correctness

Each line is the rule. [docs/invariants.md](docs/invariants.md) has the failure mode.

- The session key is the canonical artifact path. It is not a secret. No route may treat key possession as authorization. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- Never signal a listener by port alone. Stop only a Lavish PID bound to that exact address, or `POST /shutdown` on an owned server. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- Adopt, replace, or stop only a server `isOwnedServer` owns. Another installation's server at a control address is a `SERVER_ERROR`, never used, replaced, or stopped. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- Every server replacement passes all previously requested hosts through `inheritedListenHosts` (`--also-listen`), dropping only IPs no longer on a local interface. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- Loopback is always requested. An unresolvable `LAVISH_AXI_HOST` is kept (`keepUnresolved`) and retried, never silently dropped. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- A wildcard listen request becomes loopback, and an alias that resolves to an all-interfaces address is refused. Never open a wildcard listener. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- Health probes use `node:http` and destroy the socket on every exit. Do not use `fetch`. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- Loopback binds first and is the port lock. A failed requested address stays in `pendingBinds` and is retried. Declare request-handler timers before the first bind. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- Host allowlist, then Origin/Referer guard. Header-less CLI control requests must keep working. `*` skips hostname membership and still rejects a malformed forwarded authority. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- Live-event WebSockets keep the ping/pong heartbeat so half-open sockets terminate. Idle self-shutdown keys off tracked live connections, not session status. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- The detached server entrypoint logs `uncaughtException` and exits 1 explicitly. Each listener keeps its `error` handler after `listening`. [Process model](docs/invariants.md#process-model).
- `/api/:key/prompts`, `/share`, whiteboard writes, and attachment upload/delete are same-origin guarded. The key alone must never queue a prompt or publish. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Poll control `GET` and `POST` requests reject a present foreign Origin or Referer while header-less CLI requests keep working. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- The chrome page (`/session/:key`) answers `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and `frame-ancestors 'none'`. Keep that header off `/artifact/*` and `/whiteboard-frame`, which are framed. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- The artifact route injects only the one SDK `<script>` tag. Served artifact bytes otherwise match the file on disk. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Artifact asset serving (`/artifact/:key/<path>`) resolves with `realpath` and never serves a symlink target outside the artifact directory. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Layout detection never emits `feedback`. Only a user prompt and the narrow fatal artifact-failure path may wake `lavish-axi poll`. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Layout-diagnostics reports are fire-and-forget and never hold the artifact behind a round-trip. Ordinary layout findings are never relabelled fatal. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- The chrome mints each queued prompt's `prompt_id` (never from the iframe) and removes a queued note only when the transcript acknowledges that id. Evicted ids stay on `chat_ack_ids`. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Only agent chat entries render as HTML. User entries are always escaped. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- A note's Sending state is derived from the existing send bookkeeping, never tracked separately. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- `/api/:key/prompts` rejects every new batch for an ended session. Only the internal `restore` replay is exempt. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- A session the user ended never reopens without explicit opt-in (`reopen: true`, the CLI's `--reopen`). [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Poll ownership is exclusive per session in `activePolls`. Takeover installs the new holder before releasing the old one, and claims, including the reply write, serialize through `pollOwnershipLock`. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Every poll exit path undoes the presence it set and cancels the disconnect grace timer. `/api/poll` subscribes to closure before its first `await`. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Poll stdout is reserved for the final JSON/TOON response. Recurring wait ticks go to stderr only on a TTY, and notification failure never affects the poll. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- The chrome never promotes presence to `working` on send. It renders only the state the live stream reports. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- Poll feedback field order is `prompts`, `artifact_failures`, `next_step`, then `dom_snapshot`. Never move `next_step` after the snapshot. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- `takeFeedback` is destructive. A disconnected poll restores through `queuePrompts` `restore`: prepend, do not re-plan, re-emit `feedback`, and exempt only the request-wide attachment-ref cap. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- A disconnected-poll restore never overwrites a newer `dom_snapshot` or `artifact_failures` recorded after the take. [Request flow](docs/invariants.md#request-flow).
- A layout warning clears only on a newer artifact revision plus a complete pass at the same viewport class. Do not emit `feedback` for a detection. [Passive layout-warning inbox](docs/invariants.md#passive-layout-warning-inbox).
- The chrome never decides that a warning went away. Display strings come from `serializeLayoutWarnings`. [Passive layout-warning inbox](docs/invariants.md#passive-layout-warning-inbox).
- The active artifact load is durable in `session.artifact_load`. Only a newer `beginArtifactLoad` retires it, and only an explicit takeover reload replaces a superseded reviewer. [Passive layout-warning inbox](docs/invariants.md#passive-layout-warning-inbox).
- Reload and gate recovery probe `/health` before navigating. Do not call `location.reload()` directly for these recovery actions; the superseded-reviewer takeover card may reload directly after its 409 response. Sticky "Lavish is not running." copy is never cleared by a later successful load. [Live reload](docs/invariants.md#live-reload).
- Every recovery `/health` probe is bounded by an abort timeout, and its caller restores the control whether the probe answers, fails, or times out. [Live reload](docs/invariants.md#live-reload).
- Sticky copy never makes the gate overlay sticky. Every failure card keeps the bounded timeout and the **Show anyway** bypass. [Live reload](docs/invariants.md#live-reload).
- Shutdown banner text must be true for the `reason` that fired. Idle shutdown reloads nothing. [Live reload](docs/invariants.md#live-reload).
- `chrome-outdated` never reloads by itself, and a restart shows the banner instead of reloading while an unsent draft exists. The log-only shutdown `cause` is never widened into `reason`. [Live reload](docs/invariants.md#live-reload).
- Review-state restore sets values directly and dispatches no synthetic `change`/`input` events. [Live reload](docs/invariants.md#live-reload).
- A stored annotation draft is retired only after two artifact revisions report its selector missing. A retired draft is kept verbatim in `lavish-axi:retired-drafts:<key>` and never trimmed. [Live reload](docs/invariants.md#live-reload).
- The whiteboard channel token is not a secret. Trust is session-key binding plus descent from the artifact frame (`isArtifactChildWindow`). [Whiteboard](docs/invariants.md#whiteboard-mermaid-excalidraw).
- `/whiteboard-frame` stays framable by any origin and requires `?key=`. The channel token is signed over the session key. [Whiteboard](docs/invariants.md#whiteboard-mermaid-excalidraw).
- Whiteboard scenes persist in per-diagram sidecars, never in `state.json`. Stale user edits are never silently merged, and `handleInit` goes through `resolveWhiteboardInitAction`. [Whiteboard](docs/invariants.md#whiteboard-mermaid-excalidraw).
- Mermaid source stays authoritative. There is no scene-to-Mermaid reverse conversion. `mermaid` is pinned exactly. Persisted Excalidraw `appState` must not carry `theme` or a dark `viewBackgroundColor`. [Whiteboard](docs/invariants.md#whiteboard-mermaid-excalidraw).
- `/whiteboard-assets/*` keeps `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` so fonts load in the opaque-origin frame, plus `Cache-Control: no-cache` and sendFile `dotfiles: "allow"`. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- Mermaid skeletons re-materialize after Excalidraw fonts load, saved-scene repair is expansion-only, and `restoreMermaidLabelLineBreaks` runs before `convertToExcalidrawElements`. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- Every store mutation takes `store.lock`. `referencedAttachmentIds` stays lock-free. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- Attachment identity is the content-addressed file. `queuePrompts` re-derives path, mime, bytes, and dimensions from disk. Resolution is all-or-nothing. `boundAttachmentRefs` runs before any filesystem await. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- Uploads are magic-byte validated and ignore `Content-Type`. Accepted types derive from `ACCEPTED_IMAGE_MIME`, never a second hardcoded list. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- Upload results bind to the requesting document by `ATTACHMENT_NONCE` plus `event.source === parent`. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- An oversized file is decided `error` before its bytes are read. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- The composer notice is derived on every render, paste and drop go through `transferredFiles`, and the chip send gate holds back only the composer's own message and an explicit end. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- Do not put a body-parser `limit` on the attachment upload route. Drain the body, then 413. The chrome is the confused deputy for iframe uploads and shares one page-wide budget with the composer. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- Removing a chip never deletes an attachment. Only the reference-aware sweeper and the same-origin `DELETE` route for unreferenced attachments delete. No iframe-driven delete. Cap admission goes through `admitAttachmentCharge` and charges allocated blocks. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- The sweeper never removes a referenced attachment (references include the delivery grace): TTL cleanup reaps an unreferenced file past the TTL, and disk or object-cap pressure may evict an unreferenced file earlier once it is older than `ATTACHMENT_EVICTION_GRACE_MS`. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- Attachment admission runs under the store lock and refuses with 507. `maxObjects` derives from the disk budget, and `removeAttachment` deletes the sidecar first. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- A dedup upload's mtime refresh is never swallowed into success. Env limits floor before the bounds check and require `>= 1`, and only `0`/`off` disables one. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- Attachment files and dirs are owner-only (`0600`/`0700`), set explicitly at creation and re-asserted by `ensureAttachmentDir`. [Image attachments](docs/invariants.md#image-attachments).
- Export makes no outbound requests. Local reads stay inside the artifact directory after `realpath`. A symlink must not escape. [Export (local-asset inlining)](docs/invariants.md#export-local-asset-inlining).
- Export and share inline confined same-directory resources and redact every other absolute `file://` URL to `about:blank` so local paths never leak. [Export (local-asset inlining)](docs/invariants.md#export-local-asset-inlining).
- Exports strip the injected SDK and escape inlined `</script>`/`</style>`. Hosted shares never include the SDK. [Export (local-asset inlining)](docs/invariants.md#export-local-asset-inlining).
- `--unpublish` is not a deletion. There is no clear-password path. Empty share flag values are refused. A lost create response must not offer a recovery the host cannot perform. Suggested commands never contain a password placeholder. [Hosted sharing (ht-ml.app)](docs/invariants.md#hosted-sharing-ht-mlapp).
- Share passwords are minted only in `src/share-password.js`. Lavish persists neither the password nor `update_key`. [Hosted sharing (ht-ml.app)](docs/invariants.md#hosted-sharing-ht-mlapp).
- The share route echoes a password only when it minted one. [Hosted sharing (ht-ml.app)](docs/invariants.md#hosted-sharing-ht-mlapp).
- Share writes classify failure through `hostRejectedShareWrite`, where only a 4xx proves nothing landed. An echoed `site_id` is untrusted, and recovery commands come only from `republishCommand`/`unpublishCommand`. [Hosted sharing (ht-ml.app)](docs/invariants.md#hosted-sharing-ht-mlapp).
- Every surface reporting a page as newly gated carries the CDN public-to-private caveat. [Hosted sharing (ht-ml.app)](docs/invariants.md#hosted-sharing-ht-mlapp).
- `DESIGN_PRIORITY_RULE` is stated once in `src/design-reference.js`. Do not restate it. Do not hardcode one Mermaid theme. [AXI integration](docs/invariants.md#axi-integration).
- Poll wake-path guidance comes only from `POLL_WAKE_PATH_RULES`. [AXI integration](docs/invariants.md#axi-integration).
- The internal brand skill keeps `metadata.internal: true`. The generated skill omits a `version` frontmatter field. [AXI integration](docs/invariants.md#axi-integration).
- `plugin.json` and `skills/lavish` stay in `package.json` `files`. Skill frontmatter stays inside `validateSkillMarkdown`'s allowed shape. An unlinkable plugin client is reported, never thrown. Do not ship `mcp.json`. [Agent Plugins packaging](docs/invariants.md#agent-plugins-packaging).
- Plugin setup runs only on explicit invocation, drops only locations `isStalePluginLocation` attributes to this plugin, and never rewrites unparseable VS Code settings. [Agent Plugins packaging](docs/invariants.md#agent-plugins-packaging).
- Telemetry is best-effort and must never affect CLI behavior. Users opt out with `LAVISH_AXI_TELEMETRY=0`. [Telemetry](docs/invariants.md#telemetry).
- Every artifact-to-chrome message goes through `postArtifactMessage`. The artifact iframe stays sandboxed without `allow-same-origin`. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- Every `/artifact/*` response carries the CSP `sandbox` policy matching the iframe, so an escaped popup stays opaque-origin. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- SDK helpers that the browser must call are exported functions in a module `serializeModuleHelpers` inlines. No module-level constants. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- Serialized SDK helper modules export only functions. `serializeModuleHelpers` throws on any other export. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- Mermaid pan and zoom touch only the live SVG `viewBox`, never the saved artifact. `normalizeMermaidNodeTarget` strips node targets to their fixed shape. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- Table-cell annotations name a row or column only when it is provable and stay silent otherwise. `snapshot()` never computes table targets. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- A text annotation's `prompt.selector` names the container, not the selected range. Never target text by selector alone. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- Annotation handlers ignore native controls, editable regions, and `data-lavish-action` elements. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- `resetRevisionLegend()` runs only when `replaceArtifactFrame` actually assigns `frame.src`. Reject over-long revision ids and selectors. Lookups use `Map`/`Set`. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- The revision legend's per-row cap derives from `revisionPalette()` length, never a second number. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- A keyboard shortcut that must work in both chrome and the artifact needs a capture-phase listener in both `src/chrome-client.js` and `src/artifact-sdk.js`, and it requires a modifier. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- `MOBILE_SHEET_MEDIA` matches the CSS phone breakpoint, and the collapsed sheet is a `translateY`, never a height change. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- `CHROME_BOOT_FAILSAFE_JS` stays inlined before the `<script src="/chrome-client.js">` tag so the gate escape works when the client script hangs. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- A recoverable first artifact load retries through `ARTIFACT_LOAD_RECOVERY_DELAYS_MS` and then surfaces `setLayoutGateFailure`. `superseded` and `out-of-order` never retry. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- Self-paint stays a warning. Never block open and never auto-repair. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- The layout audit fails open. An empty completed pass means repaired. A failed run publishes `complete: false` and no findings. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).
- The layout audit is severe-only. Scroll dimensions alone are never proof, diagram surfaces are excluded, and a finding needs the same severe root in two samples. [Things to know when editing](docs/invariants.md#things-to-know-when-editing).

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
